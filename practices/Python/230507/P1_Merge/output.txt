A total of 2,678 students (522 for Doctor's, 1,241 for Master's, and 915 for Bachelor's) graduated.
Twin brothers received their Ph.D. degrees together.
KAIST held its commencement ceremony on February 13, 2015. Approximately 8,000 people including the graduating class, their families, faculty, staff, and friends attended the ceremony and celebrated this milestone.
President Steve Kang of KAIST congratulated the graduating students and stressed the importance of their "contribution to social growth with a compassionate heart and expertise" in his commencement address. He also mentioned that all graduates would be recognized as a "Very Important Person (VIP)" and laid out the essential characteristics of what constitutes a "true VIP": vision, innovation, and perseverance.
Among the graduates were twin brothers, Dae-Ok Kim of the Energy, Environment, Water, and Sustainability (EEWS) Graduate School and Dae-Woo Kim of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, who received their doctorates on the same day.
The older brother, Dr. Dae-Ok Kim received both his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Master's degrees from KAIST's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and later was admitted to the EEWS Graduate School for his doctorate. His dissertation was an "Investigation on the behaviors of gas molecules in water-filled nanopores: Applications to energy and environmental technology." Professor Huen Lee of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering was his faculty adviser. 
Dr. Dae-Ok Kim said, "It was a great advantage to conduct cooperative research with my brother by sharing information and discussing each other's fields." After graduating, Dr. Kim plans to research gas hydrates and porous materials at KAIST's Energy and Environmental Systems Lab for a year and to continue his research on applications in the United States.
The younger brother, Dr. Dae-Woo Kim received his B.S. from KAIST's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and was admitted to the Master of Science-Ph.D. Integrated Degree Program in the same department. His doctoral thesis was on "Direct visualization of large-area domains of two dimensional materials by using optical birefringency." His faculty adviser was Professor Hee Tae Jung of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
Dr. Dae-Woo Kim said, "During my time at the graduate school, I could overcome my difficulties by talking frankly to my brother. Our relationship deepened as we reached our academic goals together at KAIST."
Dr. Dae-Woo Kim, who published more than 25 papers in international journals such as Nature and Nanotechnology, received the Silver Prize in the Human Tech Paper Awards sponsored by Samsung Electronics Corp. in 2011. After graduating, Dr. Kim will research graphene and 2D material structure control at KAIST's Organic Opto-Electronic Materials Lab for a year and take up further research on their applications in the United States.
