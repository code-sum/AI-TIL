### 1. LangChain 이란?
> _LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models._ [(link)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction)




### 2. LlamaIndex 와의 비교
#### 2-1. LlamaIndex [(link)](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)
> _LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible data framework for connecting custom data sources to large language models._ [(link)](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)


#### 2-2. LangChain vs. LlamaIndex 비교
> ​    _"Langchain is a more general-purpose framework that can be used to build a wide variety of applications. It provides tools for loading, processing, and indexing data, as well as for interacting with LLMs. Langchain is also more flexible than LlamaIndex, allowing users to customize the behavior of their applications.
> ​    LlamaIndex is specifically designed for building search and retrieval applications. It provides a simple interface for querying LLMs and retrieving relevant documents. LlamaIndex is also more efficient than Langchain, making it a better choice for applications that need to process large amounts of data.
> ​    If you are building a general-purpose application that needs to be flexible and extensible, then Langchain is a good choice. If you are building a search and retrieval application that needs to be efficient and simple, then LlamaIndex is a better choice."_  [(link)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76990736/differences-between-langchain-llamaindex)

- **LangChain** 
  - 커스텀이 자유롭기 때문에 다양한 어플리케이션 개발에 활용할 수 있는 프레임워크
- **LlamaIndex** 
  - 어플리케이션의 검색 기능을 설계하는데 특화되어 있고, LangChain 보다 대규모 데이터를 처리하는데 효과적임
