### [CVPR 2025] RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Personalization for Multimodal Large Language Models [🗂️](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13360)


- Motivation
  - Limitation of Existing MLLM personalization
    - Strong performance in general capabilities, such as image captioning and visual question answering
    - However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life
    - Collecting personal data and training a separate model for each user is impractical, leading to issues of  cost and privacy
  - Advances and Limitations in MLLM personalization
    - MyVLM and Yo'LLaVA require training external classifiers or learning special tokens to recognize specific concepts
    - They require a large number of labeled images and negative samples, and retraining is needed whenever new concepts emerge
- Preliminary
  - Personalization for MLLMs
    - Example: <K> lives in Korea. <J> is <K>'s boyfriend.
      - (1) Personalized Captioning
        - 🤖: <K> and <J> enjoying a relaxing afternoon at a trendy cafe.
      - (2) Personalized Conversation
        - 👧: What is <K> doing?
        - 🤖: <K> is sitting at a table in a cafe, wearing a blue polka-dot dress. She is holding a glass of a pinkish drink with a straw and appears to be sipping from it.
