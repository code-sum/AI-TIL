### [CVPR 2025] RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Personalization for Multimodal Large Language Models [🗂️](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13360)


- Motivation
  - Limitation of Existing MLLM personalization
    - Strong performance in general capabilities, such as image captioning and visual question answering
    - However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life
    - Collecting personal data and training a separate model for each user is impractical, leading to issues of  cost and privacy
  - Advances and Limitations in MLLM personalization
    - MyVLM and Yo'LLaVA require training external classifiers or learning special tokens to recognize specific concepts
    - They require a large number of labeled images and negative samples, and retraining is needed whenever new concepts emerge
- Preliminary
  - Personalization for MLLMs
    - Personalizaed Captioning
    - Personalizaed Conversation
- Method
  - Remember
  - Retrieve
